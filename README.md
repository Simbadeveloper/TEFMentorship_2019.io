# How to be a mentor

<br>The process of becoming a mentor will begin with [registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBztMcYO8t8WJ8nFMkYEf0Bq3hrArWm7zuAWeVakpBOfV7UQ/viewform), which will be subject to review. <br>Following acceptance for mentorship, access to the mentorship and learning platform with its one thousand mentees will be given. <br>Matching the mentees with mentors will be by a combination of requests from mentees and administrative matching to ensure best fit.

<br><br>As a mentor, you will work with up to three assigned mentees in a task-based learning forum for 12 weeks where you will encourage each mentee to go out and implement each learning module.<br><br>

<br>The platform also features forums for both peer-to-peer and inter-group discussions and an easy integration of social media profiles (e.g. on LinkedIn) to facilitate sharing and networking.
